# Power Load Optimisation

This project involves building a REST api that can accept POST requests with information about load requirements and specifications of various powerplants. Upon receiving the POST, the api calculates a merit order and then uses this to optimise cost when choosing how much power each plant should be supplying in order to match the required load.
